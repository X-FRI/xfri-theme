## CONTRIBUTION
XFRI theme pack are classified by development tools, not by colorscheme.
For example, when making a VSCode theme, XFRI Dark, XFRI Gray and XFRI Light should be made separately in the VSCode directory, not in the project root directory.

Members of this organization only need to commit to this repo, 
other people can PR, and @muqiuhan is responsible for submitting updates to marketplace.visualstudio.com.
